# .gitkeep

This file ensures the uploads/ directory is tracked by Git while ignoring the image files inside.

The uploads folder is used to store user-uploaded images for lost and found items.

## Why this file exists?
Git doesn't track empty folders. This file keeps the folder in the repository
while the .gitignore file excludes all the uploaded images.
